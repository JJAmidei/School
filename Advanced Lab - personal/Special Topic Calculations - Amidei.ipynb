    "One of the most important types of interactions for identifying which peaks correspond to gamma-rays is Compton scattering. This happens when a photon (in our case a gamma-ray photon) is incident upon an electron, which results in a transfer of energy between the two particles and can be seen in the diagram below. \n",

    "As labeled, we can see the beginning of the Compton plateau at the backscatter peak and its ending at the Compton edge. This is created by photons that either scatter inside, or into the detector. When a photon enters the detector and scatters, it can either scatter till its energy is reduced enough for it to be fully absorbed ia the photoelectric effect (in which case the full energy is detected), or it can scatter out of the detector after having only desposited a small amount of its total energy. The energy of a scattered photon inside of the detector is then predictably between some minimum and some maximum. This maximum is energy is what we see above as the Compton edge. In almost an inverse fashion the backsactter peak is created by gammas that fly into the detector's casing and then scatters at a large angle (i.e. backscatters) into the detector. In accordance with the equation for the scatter energies we can see above, this large angle result in a reduced energy, which explain why we see this peak on the lower end of the energy spectrum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking one of these larger angles for the backscatter (roughly 180 degrees), we can find the energy at the Compton edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the diagram for $^{137}Cs$ above, we can see we have a full gamma energy around $660 \\text{ keV}$. Taking this value and calculating for two angle--160 and 180 degress--we can find energy of the peak at the Compton edge. "
